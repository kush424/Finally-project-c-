# 📘 Data Structures & Algorithms (C++ Project)

## 🔍 Project Overview

**Objective:**  
Design and implement a simple, console-based menu-driven program that includes:

- 📌 Linked List (Insert, Delete, Display)
- 📌 Merge Sort and Quick Sort (on arrays)
- 📌 Binary Search (on sorted arrays)

This project helps you understand basic data structures and fundamental algorithms.

---

## 📂 File Included

- `project.cpp`: C++ source code file containing all logic in a single program file.

---

## ⚙️ How to Compile & Run

**Using g++**

### 💻 Windows:
```bash
g++ project.cpp -o project.exe
project.exe
```

### 🐧 Linux / Mac:
```bash
g++ project.cpp -o project
./project
```

---

## 🧭 Menu Options (User Interface)

When you run the program, you'll see the following menu:

```
===== MENU =====
1. Insert into Linked List
2. Delete from Linked List
3. Display Linked List
4. Input Array
5. Display Array
6. Merge Sort Array
7. Quick Sort Array
8. Binary Search in Array
0. Exit
```

---

## 🧪 Functionalities

### 🔹 1. Linked List
- Insert a new node at the end
- Delete a node by value (first match)
- Display the linked list

### 🔹 2. Array & Sorting
- Input array elements
- Display current array
- Sort array using:
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort

### 🔹 3. Binary Search
- Search for a value in a sorted array
- ❗ If array is not sorted, warning is shown before binary search

## 🧾 Example Session (Sample Output)

```
===== MENU =====
1. Insert into Linked List
...
Enter choice: 1
Enter value: 10

Enter choice: 1
Enter value: 20

Enter choice: 3
10 -> 20 -> NULL

Enter choice: 4
Enter size of array: 5
Enter elements:
5 2 8 1 3

Enter choice: 6
Array sorted using Merge Sort.

Enter choice: 8
Enter value to search: 3
Found at index 2
```

If binary search is performed before sorting:

```
Enter choice: 8
Warning: Array is not sorted. Please sort it first using option 6 or 7.
```
